<p>A common response was that students would rather stay out all night rather than attempt to return to the dormitory past midnight. Since the dormitory opens at 5 a.m. students have to stay outside, waiting for time to pass to avoid getting demerit points. Students go to 24-hour cafés or wander around the campus. Some students nap in the sleeping room in the Student Union Building, which is open all night to those with student IDs. However, the small number of cots is not enough to accommodate all the students who need a place to sleep.</p><p style="margin-top:45px;">In the face of such situations, respondents doubt that the curfew benefits students’ safety. Although the curfew is maintained with the purpose of keeping students safely indoors at night, many students inevitably choose to stay outside all night to avoid demerit points, possibly exposing them to further danger. One respondent questioned the necessity of a curfew, since outsiders are prevented entry to the dormitory anyway.</p>
